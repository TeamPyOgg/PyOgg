# This is an example of the use of PyOgg.
#
# Author: Matthew Walker 2020-06-01
#
# An Ogg Opus file (a file containing an Opus stream wrapped inside an
# Ogg container) is loaded using the Opusfile library.  This provides
# the entire file in one PCM encoded buffer.  That buffer is converted
# to a NumPy array and then played using simpleaudio.
#
# On successful execution of this program, you should hear the audio
# being played and the console will display comething like:
#
#    Reading Ogg Opus file...
# 
#    Read Ogg Opus file
#    Channels: 2
#    Frequency (samples per second): 48000
#    Buffer Length (bytes): 960000
#    Shape of numpy array (number of samples per channel, number of channels): (240000, 2)
#    
#    Playing...
#    Duration: 0:00:05.190433
#    Finished.
